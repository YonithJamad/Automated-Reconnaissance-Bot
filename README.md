# Automated Reconnaissance Bot

This project is a powerful, integrated security analysis and scanning platform designed to simplify web reconnaissance and vulnerability assessments. By bridging multiple industry-standard security tools into a single, unified web interface, it provides seamless scanning, data management, and actionable insights.

The platform comprises an authentication system and a central dashboard where users can execute targeted scans, aggregate results, and view formatted intelligence.

## 🛠️ Security Tools & Integrations

The platform orchestrates the following security tools to perform comprehensive reconnaissance across different vectors:

*   **Initial Identification:**
    *   **Whois:** Domain registration and ownership details.
    *   **GeoIPLookup:** Geolocation tracking for target IPs.
    *   **Shodan:** Checks for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) presence and strength.
    *   **TheHarvester:** Open-source intelligence gathering for emails, subdomains, and names.
*   **Reconnaissance & Enumeration:**
    *   **Amass:** In-depth subdomain enumeration and network mapping.
    *   **WaybackMachine:** Historical archive snapshots of targeted web pages.
    *   **Wappalyzer:** Identifying underlying technologies, frameworks, and CMS used by the target.
    *   **Google Dorks:** Advanced search engine queries for exposed files and vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Network & Infrastructure Scanning:**
    *   **Nmap (TCP & UDP):** Comprehensive port scanning, service version detection, and network analysis.
*   **Web Analysis & Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   **Nikto:** Web server scanner for identifying dangerous files, outdated server software, and misconfigurations.

## 1. How to Execute the Project

### The Entry Point
The main entry point for this application is **`login_app/app.py`**. 
You should **NOT** run `main.py` directly to start the web server.

### Execution Steps
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root of the project folder.
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   **For Windows:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **For Linux / macOS:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies** (See Section 3 below).
5. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   python login_app/app.py
   ```
6. The terminal will display `[*] Starting Login Application on Port 8000...` and start the Uvicorn server.
7. Open your web browser and go to: **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**
8. You will be greeted by the Login Page.

## 2. Managing User Credentials

For security purposes, there are no default or hardcoded credentials. Passwords are securely hashed using the **SHA-256 algorithm**. To access the dashboard, you must create a user in your local database (`login_app/users.db`).

We have provided a utility script to securely add users via the terminal.

### Adding a new user
1. Navigate to the `login_app` directory.
2. Run the `add_user.py` script:
   ```bash
   python add_user.py
   ```
3. You will be prompted to securely type a new username and password.

*(Alternatively, you can provide the username in line: `python add_user.py -u myusername`)*

---

## 3. Required Modules to Download

Before running the project, you must install the required Python libraries. You can install all of them at once using `pip`.

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic jinja2 python-multipart starlette requests beautifulsoup4 python-nmap nvdlib dnspython ipwhois python-Wappalyzer setuptools==70.0.0 itsdangerous 
```

### OS-Level Dependencies
Because this bot utilizes underlying operating system commands for comprehensive scanning, ensure the following are installed and added to your system's PATH:
- **[Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html)**: Only the Nmap Python module is required for `network_logic.py` and `udp_logic.py`.
- **[Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)**: Required to run Nikto in `webanalysis_logic.py`.
- **Ping**: Native to Windows/Linux/macOS (used to check host physical reachability).

## ⚡ Concurrency & Performance Metrics

### 1. Sequential Scanning Duration (Without Concurrency)
If you execute all 8 scanning modules one after another sequentially, the total scan time is the sum of each tool's run:

*   **Initial Identification (`initial_logic.py`)**: ~10–15 seconds *(WHOIS, GeoIP, Shodan API)*
*   **Subdomain Scan (`subdomain_logic.py`)**: ~15–30 seconds *(crt.sh query + active DNS lookups)*
*   **Web Hub Scan (`webhub_logic.py`)**: ~15–20 seconds *(Wappalyzer fingerprinter + Wayback Machine)*
*   **Search Engine Intelligence (`search_logic.py`)**: ~10–15 seconds *(Google Dorking + robots.txt/sitemap check)*
*   **Email Scanner (`email_logic.py`)**: ~10–20 seconds *(OSINT scraping for contact details)*
*   **Network Scan (`network_logic.py`)**: ~2–3 minutes (120–180s) *(Nmap TCP service scan `-sV -T4` + `nvdlib` CVE lookup API)*
*   **UDP Port Scan (`udp_logic.py`)**: ~10–15 minutes (600–900s) *(Exhaustive Nmap UDP scan `-sU` across 65,535 ports)*
*   **Website Analysis (`webanalysis_logic.py`)**: ~5–15 minutes (300–900s) *(Nikto Perl script auditing web directories for 6,700+ vulnerability patterns)*

**Total Sequential Time:** $\approx 15\text{s} + 30\text{s} + 20\text{s} + 15\text{s} + 20\text{s} + 180\text{s} + 900\text{s} + 900\text{s} \approx 2080\text{s} \approx \mathbf{30 - 35\text{ minutes}}$

### 2. Asynchronous Scanning Duration (With Concurrency)
Since the modules are heavily network-bound and process-bound (spawning separate command-line subprocesses like Nmap and Nikto), they can run in parallel without blocking the main dashboard execution.

With an asynchronous engine, the total scan time is bounded by the single longest-running task (which is either the UDP scan or the Nikto web analysis scan running concurrently in the background).

**Total Asynchronous Time:** $\approx \max(\text{all scans}) \approx \mathbf{10 - 15\text{ minutes}}$

### 3. Summary of Time Saved
*   **Time Saved per Target Scan:** **~15 to 20 minutes** (reducing latency from 35 minutes down to 15 minutes).
*   **Percentage Improvement:** Over **55% to 60% time reduction** for full scans.
*   **With Caching:** When combined with the 5-day caching layer (which loads past results instantly from JSON), subsequent scans return **instantly (under 1 second)**, saving **99.9%** of scan time.

## 4. Flow of the Files

The project is structured into Authentication, API Routing, and Modular Scanning Logic.

### A. Authentication & UI (`login_app/app.py`)
- **`login_app/app.py`** is the outer shell. It initializes the FastAPI application, mounts the HTML templates and static assets (CSS/JS) directly from the `templates/` directories, and manages session cookies.
- It connects to a local SQLite database (`login_app/users.db`) to verify user credentials.
- Once authenticated, it forwards the user to the `/dashboard`.
- It crucially **imports the router from `main.py`** (`from main import router as scan_router`) to handle all scanning endpoints under the same port.

### B. Core Router & Cache Manager (`main.py`)
- **`main.py`** acts as the Traffic Controller. It receives API requests from the dashboard (e.g., `/scan?target=example.com&type=network`).
- **Caching Mechanism**: Before triggering a scan, it checks the `scan_data/` folder to see if a recent JSON file exists for the target. If it does (and is less than 5 days old), it instantly returns the cached data.
- **Ping Check**: If the target is not cached, `main.py` attempts to `ping` the host to ensure it is alive before wasting time on deep scans.
- If the host is alive, `main.py` delegates the task to the appropriate `_logic.py` module.

### C. The Modular Scanning Logic (`*_logic.py`)
Each file handles a specific type of reconnaissance. `main.py` calls them dynamically based on the requested scan type:

1. **`initial_logic.py`**: Gathers preliminary footprinting data. It delegates further to:
   - `whois_scanner.py`: Fetches domain registration details.
   - `geoiplookup.py`: Determines the geographical location of the IP.
   - `shodan_tool.py`: Queries Shodan for exposed ports and metadata.
   - `theharvester.py`: Scrapes search engines for emails and subdomains.

2. **`network_logic.py`**: Uses Python-Nmap (`nmap`) to perform deep TCP port scanning, service version detection, SSL certificate parsing, and references `nvdlib` to cross-check found services for CVEs (Vulnerabilities).

3. **`udp_logic.py`**: Performs UDP port scanning using Nmap to find services like DNS, SNMP, or NTP that might be exposed.

4. **`subdomain_logic.py`**: Enumerates subdomains using SSL Certificate Transparency logs (crt.sh) and checks for active wildcard DNS and Subdomain Takeover vulnerabilities.

5. **`webanalysis_logic.py`**: Executes the local Nikto installation (`nikto-master/program/nikto.pl` via Perl script) to deeply examine the web server for misconfigurations and outdated software.

6. **`webhub_logic.py`**: Aggregates web infrastructure details by calling:
   - `wappalyzer_scan.py`: Identifies technologies (CMS, JS frameworks) running on the site.
   - `waybackmachine.py`: Fetches historical URLs and endpoints from the Internet Archive.

7. **`search_logic.py`**: Automates Google Dorking to find exposed files, directories, or login pages indexed by Google.

8. **`email_logic.py`**: Uses `theharvester.py` to compile a list of employees or related email addresses for the target domain.

### D. Data Storage
- **`scan_data/`**: Directory where `main.py` saves the output of every completed scan as a JSON file (e.g., `example_com_network.json`). This prevents duplicate scanning.
- **`login_app/users.db`**: Stores structured username and password relationships. Standard SQLite 3 structure.
